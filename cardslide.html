          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              According to motor vehicle act 1988, section 146, says insurance
              is compulsory for all the vehicles that are running on the road.
              Motor insurance gives protection to the vehicle owner against (i).
              damages to his/her vehicle and (ii). pays for any Third Party
              Liability determined as per law against the owner of the vehicle.
              Third Party Insurance is a statutory requirement. The owner of the
              vehicle is legally liable for any injury or damage to third party
              life or property caused by or arising out of the use of the
              vehicle in a public place.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
              Comprehensive policy- it covers 3rd party loss cover + coverage
              due to theft of the vehicle + loss/ damage occurred to insurance
              holder as well + personal accident cover to owner/ driver.
            </p>
            <h3>Zero Depreciation Policy</h3>
            <p>
              It covers all the risks of comprehensive policy and depreciation
              cover is also added. In this policy, 100% claim is obtained on all
              the plastic parts, fibre parts, rubber parts (e.g., bumper, tyres
              etc.). There is no depreciation deduction on these parts of the
              vehicle. The premium of this policy is more than comprehensive
              policy.
            </p>
            <h3>Comprehensive Policy</h3>
            <p>
              There are mainly 2 types of insurance policy:
              <ol style="padding-left: 16px;">
                <li>Third party insurance policy</li>
                <li>Comprehensive insurance policy</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Third Party Insurance:</strong> It only covers the damage
              to the property/loss occurred to the other party due to accident
              done by the insurance holder. It does not cover any loss/damage
              occurring to the insurance holder.
            </p>
            <p>
              It does not cover the loss of vehicle due to theft of vehicle, but
              loss due to theft can be added by paying extra premium.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Comprehensive Insurance:</strong> Comprehensive policy covers third party
              loss cover + coverage due to theft of vehicle + loss/ damage
              occurred to insurance holder as well + personal accident cover to
              owner/ driver.
